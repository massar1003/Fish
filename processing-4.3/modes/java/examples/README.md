Example files for "processing4" and "processing-website" 

There are many more examples included with the Processing software download than appear on the Processing.org site. If a change needs to be made with an example on the website, it should be changed here. A script in the website build process copies over the PDE files from this repository. If a website example is changed, there are additional files that need to be changed within "processing-website":

- A JSON file with the metadata for the example
- A PNG image with output of the example
- A liveSketch.js file with a translated p5.js sketch of the PDE code 

The examples without a credit line were written by Casey Reas or Ben Fry and they are in the public domain. Daniel Shiffman's examples are in the public domain.
